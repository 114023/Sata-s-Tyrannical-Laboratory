            BAM! BpongeSob and Fatrick had fallen to Rock Bottom, luckily they weren't hurt. All they needed was a way out, but the bus station closed due to a snail-eating barnacle infestation. Petah and I witnessed this unfold while watching the fourth episode of BpongeSob Season twenty-five in 3D using our Sata Quest 4's. Sata was the company behind the Quest series, and they were run by Zark Muckerburg, who had acquired more and more companies each month. Petah and I were surprised they didn't own the world at that point. The summer days had kept getting hotter in Pennsylvania, and at Petah's house there was no air conditioning. The year 2032 had been one of the hottest on record, so I wasn't really surprised by the heat waves but I really wanted an excuse to go somewhere other than there. This was around the time of the official Sata Quest 5 announcement. It had started with a base price of $699. We had both been eager to upgrade our gear. While we were watching BongeSob, both of our Eyon Tusk BrainLink chips rang simultaneously. We decided to answer it despite our data plan running low. Turns out it was a call from representatives of Zark Muckerburg's company, Sata. They explained to me and Petah that we had been selected to participate in the new closed beta for the Sata Quest 5 Virtual Reality headset, which was a staple of modern technology. Petah was skeptical as always, but I was eager the moment my BrainLink understood what was happening. We both agreed and entered the destination code provided by the representatives into our matter transporter. Just before going through the matter transporter, our shared data plan ran out. We bickered on who used the most data. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I exclaimed, “You never let me call my friends, so YOU used the data!"
	</p>
	<p>
	To which he responded in a sincere yet firm voice, “You call and text them behind my back, so you—"
	</p>

	<p>
	Just then, he remembered how the Wi-Fi had been off for days, and we've been watching BpongeSob off data, and only had ourselves to blame. After getting over that conundrum, we stepped through the matter transporter. Within 30 seconds, we were transported to the Sata technology lab in Nevadah. The journey was simple, the only caveat was the slight memory loss. You typically forget a thing or two as the matter transporter can’t entirely replicate brain functions too well.
        </p>
	<p>
	As we stepped into the facility, a wave of awe crashed into us. What we comprehended was a mesmerizing blend of sleek architecture where each countertop was made from a smooth, sleek, mesmerizing marble and granite mixture, cutting-edge technology, and innovative design that seemed to extend past the boundaries of all modern architectural design. The sub-buildings were composed of graceful curves and metallic finishes, reflecting the neon lighting in a mind-boggling display of shimmering lights. We were immediately greeted by this Unknown Narrator who oddly enough went by the name “Unknown Narrator”. After the mysterious introduction, he told us to put on the Quest 5, to which we instantly obliged. They were locked with passwords customizable for each development and prototype unit as explained by the Unknown Narrator, so we needed to find it. He explained how even the first challenge is impossible and how once we commit we can’t quit till we finish. 
        </p>
	<p>
	"Anything is possible, all you have to do is believe!" I remarked, as Petah was skeptical and needed reassurance.
	</p>
	<p>
	Petah was still uncertain, and he made it clear by saying, “I don't know, man. It just seems too far-fetched.”
	</p>
	<p>
	“Trust me, I've seen incredible things happen when people believe in themselves. You've got this!”	</p>
	<p>
 	Once he heeded what I put forth he announced, “I guess you're right. I'll give it a shot. Thanks for believing in me, man.”	
	</p>
	<p>
	Despite reassuring him, I was also panicking. After silently mustering up the courage to start our first puzzle, I started my journey to find the password. Within the first hour, I had no idea what or where it could be. I ended up giving up, so I grimly trotted back to the entrance. I told the Unknown Narration, “I quit.” Just after accepting defeat, both of the headsets chimed. Turns out the code was “I quit.” I was left speechless. After regaining my thoughts I slipped on the headset and was transported to the first of many chambers. The chamber featured pristine white and black walls and floors, neon edges and corners, high-tech sliding doors, neon red pressure plates, and white-and-blue checkerboard surfaces. It was covered in flawless high-definition Sata logos and equipped with elements such as weighted cubes, buttons, turrets, and observation windows, all set within a clean, sterile environment designed for what seems to be some sort of puzzle game. The whole experience seemed so real, especially since the headsets had realistic hand and body tracking. I nearly mistook my in-game avatar for my real-life body. The sensation was uncanny and I almost forgot where I was. As I snapped out of my mind, I realized how tightly the headset was fastened and I asked if it could be adjusted. Unknown Narrator snubbed my request, so I just waited for instructions. I was told how Petah and I could work together and also ask the Unknown Narrator for hints. We were told how we get 2 hints per level and could unlock hidden cheat codes left by others’. In the enigmatic testing facility, Petah and I faced a series of challenging test chambers, each with its own unique puzzles and obstacles. We relied on the cryptic hints provided by the Unknown Narrator, which often required us to think creatively and out-of-the-box. 	
	</p>
	<p>
	As we delved deeper into the facility, the puzzles became increasingly complex, and we learned the importance of using our two hints per level. Along the way, we discovered hidden cheat codes left by previous participants and sympathetic developers, adding an element of mystery to our adventure. Despite the grueling nature of the tests, our determination and belief that anything is possible drove us forward, while any attempt at requesting a break or refreshment was met with a disapproving hissing sound, emphasizing the facility's unwavering demand for focus and perseverance. I asked what the hissing sounds were, and that's when the Unknown narrator whispered under his now artificially modulated breath, "That's the final boss, Zar-” Just then, he was silenced by a sudden burst of static noise. We were left to ponder on what had transpired, and it quickly became evident. The Unknown Narrator had been abruptly cut off right before revealing the name "Zar," and given the context that the creator of the Sata Quest console series is Zark Muckerburg, with allegations surrounding his true identity as a lizard person, it was evident that the final boss was none other than Zark Muckerburg himself! The chambers in the game clearly took inspiration from my favorite puzzle game series, Shortal, prompting us to consider breaking free from the game's constraints. By using a noclip cheat code discovered in the early levels, we managed to phase through the walls and immerse ourselves in a chilling, desolate void unlike any we had ever seen. This unexpected experience left us astounded. We were shaken to our core, and were left there for what felt like hours. We were snapped back to reality when the  headsets chimed once again revealing the headset batteries were low. We were forced to act fast. We used invincibility cheat codes and speed boost codes to race to the last level, the boss fight. As the headset batteries were slowly dying off, Petah and I found ourselves in the last room, determined to end the reign of Zark Muckerburg, the ruler of the vast virtual Sataverse. With every second, a resounding tick echoed through our headsets, accompanied by increasing glitches that threatened to engulf our success.
